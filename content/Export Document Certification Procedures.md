# Export Document Certification Procedures

### 18th January 2022

## Introduction

For over 50 years New Zealand exporters have obtained Chamber of Commerce issued Certificates of Origin and utilised Chambers of Commerce to endorse trade documents.

The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) arrangements with the World Customs Organisation (WCO) underpins the role of Chambers of Commerce internationally delivering Certificates of Origin. A service to exporters which can be traced back to the 1923 Geneva Convention relating to the Simplification of Customs Formalities, Article 11 (eventually updated by the Kyoto Convention).

Certificates of Origin may be required so that the Customs Authorities in the importing Country can establish the applicable tariff, ensure that quota restrictions are not being breached and collect statistical data.

The buyer/importer will usually identify whether a Certificate of Origin is required for a consignment and what, if any, other documents will require Chamber of Commerce endorsement.

The New Zealand Chambers of Commerce (NZCCI) accredit Chambers of Commerce in New Zealand to issue Non-preferential Certificates of Origin and endorse trade documents. The procedures outlined in this manual are to be read in conjunction with:

·       “ICC International Certificate of Origin Guidelines”

·       NZCCI Electronic Non-Preferential Certification Manual and/or

·       NZCCI Electronic Certification Manual

NB: Certification of ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand and China New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (FTA) Certificates of Origin is limited to those Chambers of Commerce authorised by New Zealand Customs. Applications must be made online at www.chamberdocs.co.nz and will be issued electronically only by New Zealand Chamber of Commerce signatories authorised by New Zealand Customs with specifically designated New Zealand Chamber of Commerce seals
